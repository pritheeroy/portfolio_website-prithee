    title: 'Machine Learning Framework for Number Detection',
    description: "Researched and implemented Machine Learning model which accurately predicts handwritten numbers. Pixels are supplied from a multidimensional array through a neural network that has 98% accuracy predicting numbers. Tensorflow and Keras was used extensively to build the model. PyGame was used to develop the interactive portion.",
